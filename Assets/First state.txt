Dragons raided your town, spitting fire and shit (not literally).
You are in your house looking at the situation through your room in the second floor.

You want to take action but you didn't finish your knight training.

Anyway, wyd?
1. Equip your armor and weapons and jump out of the window
2. Run run run! Outside the town
